# PSCS_282-AI-driven-Crop-Disease-Prediction-and-Management-System
AI-driven system for early detection and management of crop diseases using deep learning. Predicts diseases from leaf images and provides actionable recommendations, helping farmers reduce yield loss and improve sustainable farming practices. 

ðŸ“Œ Project Description:

The AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System is designed to help farmers detect and manage crop diseases quickly and effectively. Crop diseases cause major losses in yield and income, and their early identification is often difficult because it requires expert knowledge. Farmers usually rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and often results in delayed treatment.

This project leverages artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to automatically identify crop diseases from leaf images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning models like ResNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, the system can achieve high accuracy in disease detection. Beyond detection, the system provides instant diagnosis, treatment suggestions, and preventive measures, which makes it unique compared to existing tools that only focus on identifying the disease.

The solution is developed as a lightweight, mobile-friendly application to ensure accessibility for farmers. It accepts inputs such as leaf images and environmental data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) and provides outputs including disease classification, severity prediction, and recommended actions. By combining detection with management advice, the system offers a complete decision-support tool for farmers.

Overall, the project aims to deliver a farmer-friendly, cost-effective, and scalable solution that not only improves productivity but also contributes to sustainable agriculture by reducing crop losses and supporting food security.
